The example of the Downloader is based on the XDCC protocol, one of the many IRC extensions. It is used to semi automatically distribute files. The init events stand or the announcement of a desired file by the distributing site. The padding event is the state where the client requested the desired file of the disturber but no answer arrived yet. Similarly the loading event represents the state where the distributing side answered to the request and started a connection. Finally there are the progressed, the finished and the aborted events. Progressed stands for the simple progress of the file transmission. The site reacting to that event is responsible of receiving the data, storing and sending the ack to the distributer. Aborted stands for the abortion of the download. It can be triggered by the distributer, the user or simply by a corrupt connection. Correspondingly the site handling this event has to notify the user and 'clean up the mess'. Finally the finished event signals the successful transfer of a file.
Following are the sides handling the different stages of a download cycle.
- D1 is the start of the cycle, a new episode of one of the web series was released
- D2 the series was requested from the server but no answer has yet arrived, so the download is padding
- D3 the answer from the server arrived, the download can start
- D4 the download started and first data arrived
- D5 now different things can happen, the download may further progress, be aborted by the user, the server or a connection error or he may be finished. There is no such thing as an endless file!
